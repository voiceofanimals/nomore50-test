    Incidences of cruelty to animals in India, each more shocking than the last, are frequently reported by media outlets. Dogs are poisoned, cows have been burned with acid, and countless other animals across the country are abused every day.

Yet people convicted of such crimes often only pay a paltry Rs 50 fine – the maximum penalty for a first offence of animal abuse under The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. 

Please help prevent violence against animals by strengthening India's animal protection laws and penalties for abusers. I respectfully ask that you show that cruelty to animals won't be tolerated by ensuring that people found guilty of it receive jail time, significant fines, and counselling and are forbidden to have contact with animals.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter.
